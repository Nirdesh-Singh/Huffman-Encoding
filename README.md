# Text File Compressor (Huffman Encoding)

This project supports two functions:

1. Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2. Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.

# Summary

1. Developed a command-line interface text file compression tool in Java.
2. Implemented Huffman encoding algorithm for efficient compression.
3. Achieved up to 40% compression on text files, resulting in reduced storage and transmission requirements.
